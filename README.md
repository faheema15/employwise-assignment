# Users List Project

## Project Overview
This project is a React-based web application that fetches and displays a list of users from an API. Users can be edited or deleted using the interface. The project is built using React with Material UI for styling.

## Features
- Fetch users from an API.
- Display users in a responsive grid layout.
- Edit user details.
- Delete users.

## Technologies Used
- React
- TypeScript
- Material UI
- Axios (for API calls)

## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before starting:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd users-list-project
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   or if using yarn:
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   or with yarn:
   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```
4. Open the application in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## API Assumptions
- The project fetches users from `https://reqres.in/api/users`.
- User data includes `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `avatar`.
- Editing a user updates state locally (not persisted in the API).
- Deleting a user removes them from the UI (not persisted in the API).

## Considerations
- API failures should be handled gracefully.
- The UI is responsive and works on different screen sizes.
- Further optimizations could include state management (Redux, Context API) and performance improvements.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate a backend to persist user changes.
- Implement authentication.
- Improve error handling and loading states.
